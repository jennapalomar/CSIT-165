# Exercise 3: vector practice

# Create a vector `words` of 6 (or more) words.
# You can Google for a "random word generator" if you wish!
words <- c("hi", "my", "name", "is", "jenna", "s")

# Create a vector `words_of_the_day` that is your `words` vector with the string
# "is the word of the day!" pasted on to the end using `paste0()`.
# BONUS: Surround the word in quotes (e.g., `'data' is the word of the day!`)
# Note that the results are more obviously correct with single quotes.
words_of_the_day <- paste0(words," " ,"is the word of the day")

# Create a vector `a_f_words` which are the elements in `words` that start with 
# "a" through "f"
# Hint: use a comparison operator to see if the word comes before "f" alphabetically!
# Tip: make sure all the words are lower-case, and only consider the first letter
# of the word! `substring()` is a great function for isolating the first letter of 
# the word alphabetically. This could be used inside the vector index with a compparison 
# operator. Remember



# Create a vector `g_m_words` which are the elements in `words` that start with 
# "g" through "m"
# Hint: You can do this in one statement or two statments, but if you use one 
# statement you will need a `&` operator.
